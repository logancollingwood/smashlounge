Source code for http://www.smashLounge.com

<h1> Installation </h1>
Clone the repository into the root directory of your local website
<hr>

### dependencies:
===========
1. XAMPP or WAMPP, or any *AMP stack.

2. Composer


<hr>
### Install composer:

	with curl -> ```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php```

	without curl -> ```php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php```

Run php composer install in the repository directory. This will read composer.json and install
all necessary dependencies for the website. A directory will be created called 'src' which contains
Cartalyst Sentry, which is used for user authentication.
<hr>
### Upload schema:

If you are using XAMPP or WAMP, you have access to phpmyadmin. Use the schema located in schema/mysql.sql
to replicate our database. Create a database called 'thalounge', and run the sql script to populate the tables.

<hr>
### Export connection credentials to the client scripts.

Create 'db.php' and 'dbSuper.php' in the techs/ directory to hold authentication credentials.
db should hold the credentials for a user that has READ only access to the tables, and dbSuper should hold credentials for a user that has READ/WRITE access to the tables. This separation of credentials will allow us to provide write access to scripts which explicitly need write access (ie credentials for submitting).

db.php 
```php
$username="smashlounge";
$password="";
$database="thalounge";
$dahostname="localhost";
```

dbSuper.php
```php
$username = 'submit';
$password = '';
$dahostname = 'localhost';
$dbname = 'thalounge';
$table = 'submissions';
```

relevant information:
===========
Accessor functions are mostly found in the /techs directory, where I wrote scripts to access the database and initialize arrays which are referenced from the template pages, following MVC principles.


API:
===========
Most of the data on our website is accessible via API call. For information on accessing this data, visit smashlounge.com/api/docs. If what you're looking for doesn't exist in our API yet, contact me and I'll write the code so you can get the data you want. I haven't gotten to writing most of the API yet, as I'm focused mostly on developing new features.

Installing Dependencies
=======================

Smashlounge uses a few Composer dependencies.  Please use composer to install or update in the root directory, once you've downloaded the repo.
