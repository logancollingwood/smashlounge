Accessor functions are mostly found in the /techs directory, where I wrote scripts to access the database and initialize arrays which are referenced from the template pages.


API:
===========
Most of the data on our website is accessible via API call. For information on accessing this data, visit smashlounge.com/api/docs. If what you're looking for doesn't exist in our API yet, contact me and I'll write the code so you can get the data you want. I haven't gotten to writing most of the API yet, as I'm focused mostly on developing new features.
