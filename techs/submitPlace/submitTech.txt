DESCRIPTION: Our daughter, Erin KV has written articles for your paper. Coming from a doting grandmother I check and read the postings or listings. I can’t find how to enter your “ticket” for Saturday’s drawing, but I would hope I would win them for her. This is a roundabout way to get me entered for the drawing. I would be so thankful for her if you would.
